## YUI AND THE FUTURE by Eric Ferraiuolo

A look at where the Web Platform is heading and how YUI fits into that future and continues to help you build web apps that run on many devices.

### What is YUI?

* a set of design principles
* infrastructure
* code organization
* abstraction
* loading

### The web platform

#### The Past
* Desktop browsers
* Basic HTML/CSS, JavaScript

#### Current
* HTML5/CSS3
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript (ES5)
* JavaScript (ES3)
* Mobile
* Desktop

#### The Future
* Javascript (ES6)
* Web Components

#### ES6
* Proxies
* Modules
* let
* promises
* sets
* maps
* generators
* iterators
* =>
* class

#### Web Components
* Templates
* Decorators
* Custom Elements
* shadow DOM
* imports

#### Evergreen Browsers
Install once, update new stuff all the time. Big change. Used to browsers with long release cycles.

### The Web Platform + YUI
The role of YUI, or any framework, lib, polyfill, etc. is to fill in the gaps and smooth out the curve so we can write these long living applications.

### YUI + ES6 Modules
ES6 modules are defining a new syntax to declaritively import from other modules and export.

The goal is to use tooling to transpile modules into es6 modules. allows for backwards compatability.
